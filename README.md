# Green Supplier Selection (GSS) Project Proposal

## Introduction

The Green Supplier Selection (GSS) Project aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for evaluating and ranking suppliers based on their environmental sustainability practices. This method will use various techniques and tools, including TOPSIS for multicriteria decision-making, machine learning for predictive analysis, and expert evaluation.

## Project Goals

We seek to:

* Develop an evaluation framework based on sustainability criteria that experts agree upon.
* Evaluate suppliers based on environmental sustainability criteria, using a standardised form.
* Employ machine learning techniques to identify the most important supplier evaluation criteria.
* Create predictive models to categorise suppliers based on their environmental performance.
* Predict a supplier's green image and categorise it as green or not.
* Implement the framework, assess a group of suppliers, test, and validate the results.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect to develop a standardised methodology for organisations to select environmentally friendly suppliers. The evaluation framework will be validated for accuracy and usefulness, and predictive models will be benchmarked against existing methods. The ultimate outcome will be a comprehensive set of tools that any organization can use to make informed decisions about choosing suppliers trusted to operate with high environmental sustainability.
